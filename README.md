# Gothons_Web_Game

This is the start of my Sinatra web game, based off of the last exercise in Zed Shaw's "Learn Ruby the Hard Way."
It is a web based adventure game in which a player goes through several rooms and solves various problems to 
complete the game. 

The web app currently works but needs further tweaking.  Right now, it is pretty much identical to the one
Zed wrote in the last chapter of the book.  I am currently working to make the "Laser Weapon Armory" room
use a random number for the keypad code and allow the player 10 guesses to get the correct code.  There is a lot
more to be done on this app, but this is a solid start.

## Built with:
- Mostly Ruby
- Sinatra
- HTML
